   * Verifies that convergence survives hostile delivery order, reconstruction
   * from a retained Sequence, and later redelivery of already integrated Gossip.
   *
   * Five independent actors each create one concurrent root insertion against
   * an empty Sequence.
   *
   * The same operation set is then reconstructed through two paths:
   *
   * - `ordered` receives all five mutations in their original collection order;
   * - `restarted` receives the same mutations in a deterministic shuffled order
   *   and is recreated partway through delivery from its retained Sequence.
   *
   * After reconstruction, every original mutation is deliberately delivered
   * again. Those stale Gossip packets must be idempotent and must not duplicate
   * visible Footage or alter deterministic root ordering.
   *
   * Finally, a fresh Projection is created directly from the fully integrated
   * restarted Sequence. Creation may compact or normalize local structural
   * state, but its visible Projection must remain identical to both live
   * receivers.
   *
   * This therefore checks that:
   *
   * - concurrent root ordering is independent of arrival order;
   * - retained Sequence state is sufficient to survive a restart;
   * - stale Gossip redelivery is idempotent;
   * - creating a fresh Projection from retained state preserves the result.
