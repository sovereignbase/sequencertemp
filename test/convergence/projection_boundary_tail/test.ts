  /**
   * Verifies that a replacement Insert remains paired with its remove when the
   * replaced Frame sits at the tail of its local branch and reconstruction
   * occurs before the replace is delivered.
   *
   * `primary` first builds a root and then inserts a four-Frame branch before
   * it. A second actor concurrently creates its own root. `primary` then
   * replaces the trailing `root` Frame and continues inserting new head
   * Footage.
   *
   * The same mutation history is reconstructed twice:
   *
   * - `ordered` applies every mutation continuously;
   * - `restarted` is recreated from retained Sequence state after the first
   *   three mutations, before the tail replacement arrives.
   *
   * Both paths must converge. In particular, reconstruction must preserve the
   * structural relationship required for the later replace remove and its
   * replacement Insert to resolve as one replacement rather than losing,
   * duplicating, or misplacing the replacement Footage.
