   * Verifies that a concurrent root and the complete causal subtree of another

   * duplicated, or lost.
   *
   * `primary` creates a two-Frame root and then repeatedly inserts descendants
   * at its head:
   *
   *   fifth
   *   fourth
   *   third
   *   first
   *   root-0
   *   root-1
   *
   * `concurrent` independently creates another root from the same empty
   * Sequence. It therefore competes with the complete primary root subtree
   * rather than becoming one of its descendants.
   *
   * The same Gossip history is reconstructed once continuously and once with
   * a restart after the concurrent root has been delivered. Both paths must
   * converge to the same seven Frames and preserve every authored value exactly
   * once.
