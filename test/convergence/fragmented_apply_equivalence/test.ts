   * Verifies that an insertion anchored exactly at a previously fragmented
   * Projection boundary resolves to the same structural position locally and
   * remotely.
   *
   * The test first creates and then replaces an initial two-frame insertion:
   *
   *   [1, 1]
   *      ↓ replace
   *   [2, 2]
   *
   * A new insertion is then added at the beginning:
   *
   *   [3, 3, 2, 2]
   *
   * Although the visible Projection is simple, its Structural Order now
   * contains edit history from the original insertion and its replacement.
   * The boundary between `[3, 3]` and `[2, 2]` therefore represents a useful
   * fragmented-boundary case rather than merely a boundary between two
   * untouched inserts.
   *
   * The final insertion is authored at Projection Frame 2, exactly at that
   * boundary:
   *
   *   [3, 3 | 2, 2]
   *          ↑
   *        insert
   *
   * The locally authored result must be:
   *
   *   [3, 3, 7, 7, 2, 2]
   *
   * Applying the resulting Gossip remotely must anchor `[7, 7]` at exactly the
   * same structural location. This specifically guards against local and remote
   * paths resolving the same visible boundary through different fragments or
   * containment history and consequently choosing different anchors.
