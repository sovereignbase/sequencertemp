  /**
   * Verifies that concurrent root insertions and their causal subtrees are
   * ordered deterministically and remain structurally contiguous regardless of
   * Gossip delivery order.
   *
   * Four actors begin from an empty Sequence. Each independently creates its
   * own root insertion and then extends that root on both sides:
   *
   *   left <- root -> right
   *
   * For each actor:
   *
   *   insert(root, 0)
   *   insert(left, 0)
   *   insert(right, 2)
   *
   * produces the local Projection:
   *
   *   left, root, right
   *
   * The four root operations are concurrent with one another, while each
   * actor's left and right insertions are causally attached to its own root.
   *
   * When all operations are merged, Sequencer must choose one deterministic
   * order for the competing roots. Their descendant trees must move with those
   * roots as complete subtrees rather than becoming interleaved with descendants
   * belonging to another concurrent root.
   *
   * Forward and reverse delivery must therefore reconstruct the same Projection,
   * and every actor's:
   *
   *   left, root, right
   *
   * range must remain contiguous in that Projection.
