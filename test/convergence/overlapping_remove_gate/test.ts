   * Verifies that overlapping reducing operations do not move a receiver's

   *
   * Three replicas begin from the same retained two-Frame Sequence. They then
   * independently author overlapping removals, a replacement, and additional
   * insertions around the same original region.
   *
   * The resulting Structural Order contains positive insertions together with
   * multiple signed remove debts covering overlapping historical Frames.
   *
   * The complete operation set is reconstructed twice:
   *
   * - `ordered` receives the mutations in their authored collection order;
   * - `unordered` receives exactly the same mutations in a deliberately reordered
   *   sequence beginning with later removals.
   *
   * Both receivers must converge to the same Projection. In addition, the
   * unordered delivery must leave its local gate positioned at Projection zero.
   * Signed remove debt around the head must therefore not shift the logical
   * zero-reservation represented by that gate.
