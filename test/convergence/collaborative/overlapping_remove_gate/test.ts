   * Three replicas begin from the same retained two-Frame Sequence. They then
   * independently author overlapping removals, a replacement, and additional
   * insertions around the same original region.
   *
   * The resulting Structural Order contains positive insertions together with
   * multiple removals covering overlapping historical Frames.
   *
   * The complete operation set is reconstructed twice:
   *
   * - `ordered` receives the mutations in their authored collection order;
   * - `unordered` receives exactly the same mutations in a deliberately reordered
   *   sequence beginning with later removals.
   *
   * Both receivers must converge to the same Projection. If a removal consumes
   * the unordered receiver's gate, it follows neighbouring surviving content.
