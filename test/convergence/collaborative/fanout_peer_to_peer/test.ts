/**
 * Verifies convergence between three continuously running browser peers while

 * Gossip in a different network order.
 *
 * The peers communicate through BroadcastChannel. Every receiver applies a
 * deterministic sender/editor-specific delay, so cross-sender operations are
 * intentionally observed in different orders.
 *
 * The workload has two phases:
 *
 * 1. All three editors independently create concurrent root insertions.
 * 2. Each editor continues with three timed insert/replace/remove operations
 *    against its own live Projection.
 *
 * No local edit waits for a remote packet. The edit intervals are merely longer
 * than the bounded network jitter, allowing ordinary causal continuation while
 * concurrent cross-peer operations still arrive in different orders.
 *
 * After all eight remote updates have reached every peer:
 *
 * - all three visible Projections must be identical;
 * - every remote update must have been accepted;
 * - every local mutation must have been accepted.
 *
 * This exercises live peer convergence through the browser Projection API,
 * real browser event loops, timers, BroadcastChannel delivery, and independent
 * network reordering.
