  /**
   * Verifies that a local replacement leaves the gate positioned against the
   * left side of the replaced region so that a following insertion resolves
   * against the replacement Footage rather than the original Strip boundary.
   *
   * The Projection evolves as:
   *
   *   a, b, c
   *
   * Replacing the first two Frames produces:
   *
   *   x, y, c
   *
   * The next insertion targets Projection position 1, between `x` and `y`:
   *
   *   x | y, c
   *     ↑
   *     z
   *
   * The gate and its projected index must therefore still describe that visible
   * left-side boundary after the replacement. The insertion must resolve to:
   *
   *   x, z, y, c
   *
   * If the replacement leaves the gate indexed on the wrong side of the split
   * structure, the following insertion can anchor against the wrong fragment.
