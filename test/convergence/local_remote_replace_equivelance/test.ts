   * - replacement of an existing Strip with an equal-length Strip;
   * - removal of an existing Strip;
   * - insertion at a random structural position;

   * - reads between mutations, allowing traversal state and cached jumps to be
   *   exercised before later structural mutations.

   * test concurrent operations created independently before replicas exchange
   * updates, nor convergence under different Gossip delivery orders.
