  /**
   * Verifies that a concurrent root insertion remains outside a causally
   * authored replacement, including when the receiving replica is restarted
   * partway through delivery.
   *
   * `primary` builds its own causal history:
   *
   *   root
   *   branch-0, branch-1, branch-2, branch-3, root
   *   replaced-head, branch-0, branch-1, branch-2, branch-3, root
   *
   * It then replaces Projection range [0, 2], removing `replaced-head` and
   * `branch-0` and inserting:
   *
   *   replacement-0, replacement-1
   *
   * Meanwhile, `concurrent` independently inserts its own root-level operation
   * without observing any of that causal replacement history.
   *
   * The replacement Mask must therefore remain scoped to the operations visible
   * to `primary` when the replacement was authored. It must not absorb the
   * concurrent root merely because later reconstruction places that operation
   * beside or inside the same structural region.
   *
   * The same Gossip sequence is reconstructed both continuously and with a
   * restart during delivery. Both paths must converge and preserve the same
   * visible operation set.
