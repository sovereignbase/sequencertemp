  /**
   * Verifies that same-actor insertions preserve the exact anchor points visible
   * in the author's Projection when each operation was created.
   *
   * Every insertion in this scenario resolves to a distinct anchor coordinate.
   * No two operations compete for the same anchor, so convergence must not
   * depend on any tie-break rule.
   *
   * The authoring sequence evolves as follows:
   *
   *   root
   *   first, root
   *   second, first, root
   *   second, middle, first, root
   *   fourth, second, middle, first, root
   *   fifth, fourth, second, middle, first, root
   *
   * The corresponding anchors are:
   *
   * - `root`   -> virtual root anchor
   * - `first`  -> `(root, 0)`, before the `root` Frame
   * - `second` -> `(first, 0)`, before the `first` Frame
   * - `middle` -> `(second, 1)`, after the `second` Frame
   * - `fourth` -> `(second, 0)`, before the `second` Frame
   * - `fifth`  -> `(fourth, 0)`, before the `fourth` Frame
   *
   * The important case is `middle`. It is authored at visible Projection
   * position 1 while the view is:
   *
   *   second | first, root
   *          ↑
   *        insert
   *
   * Its anchor must therefore remain `(second, 1)`, even if the operation is
   * later delivered into a replica whose current structural view has already
   * been fragmented differently by other insertions.
   *
   * Two replicas are reconstructed from the same empty Sequence:
   *
   * 1. `ordered` receives mutations in authoring order.
   * 2. `unordered` receives the same mutations in a deliberately reordered
   *    delivery sequence, including delivery of `middle` before `second`.
   *
   * Because each mutation carries the stable anchor coordinate resolved from
   * its authoring view, both delivery orders must reconstruct exactly the same
   * final Projection:
   *
   *   fifth, fourth, second, middle, first, root
