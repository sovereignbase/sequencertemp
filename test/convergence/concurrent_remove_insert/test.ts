  /**
   * Verifies that a remove only removes the Insertion it was authored against
   * and does not consume a concurrent Insertion anchored beside that content.
   *
   * Both replicas begin from:
   *
   *   a, b, c
   *
   * One replica removes `b` while the other concurrently inserts `beside`
   * immediately after `b`:
   *
   *   deleting:  a, [b], c
   *                  ↓ remove
   *
   *   inserting: a, b | c
   *                    ↑
   *                 beside
   *
   * Because neither operation has observed the other, the insertion is not
   * part of the remove's origin. The remove must therefore remove only `b` and
   * retain the concurrent insertion:
   *
   *   a, beside, c
   *
   * The same operation set is delivered in both possible orders to verify that
   * remove ownership is independent of delivery order.
