  /**
   * Verifies that a complete concurrent root subtree retains its deterministic
   * position even when that subtree is delivered before the competing root.
   *
   * Two replicas begin from the same empty Sequence and independently build
   * their own root subtrees:
   *
   *   primary-5
   *   primary-3
   *   primary-2
   *   primary-root
   *
   *   concurrent-4
   *   concurrent-root
   *
   * The two roots are concurrent, while the descendants within each subtree
   * are causally ordered by their authoring replica.
   *
   * The hostile delivery sends the complete concurrent subtree first:
   *
   *   concurrent-root
   *   concurrent-4
   *
   * before delivering the competing primary root and its descendants.
   *
   * Once both receivers contain the complete operation set, the two root
   * subtrees must occupy the same deterministic Structural Order regardless of
   * delivery order. Descendants belonging to one root must remain with that
   * root rather than becoming interleaved with the competing subtree.
