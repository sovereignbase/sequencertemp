   * Every mutation is delivered immediately, so both peers contain the same
   * authored operations after each step. Their local gate and jump caches may,
   * however, differ because each peer reaches the same structure through
   * different local mutation and remote-apply paths.

   * optimization is completely transparent:

   *   same authored state + same Projection position -> same Footage
   *
   * regardless of which signed jumps or local gate happen to be used to reach
   * that position.
   *
   * The workload repeatedly:
   *
   * - inserts visible Footage;
   * - replaces visible ranges, creating both replacement Footage and Masks;
   * - removes ranges entirely;
   * - inserts again around previously masked and fragmented boundaries;
   * - authors replacements from both peers.
   *
   * After every Gossip delivery, every Projection position is compared between
   * the two live peers. The final assertion also fixes the expected visible
   * Footage after the complete mutation history.
