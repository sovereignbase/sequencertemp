   * head:

   *   primary-5
   *   primary-4
   *   primary-1
   *   primary-root

   * deterministically without allowing the primary descendants to become
   * separated from their root by another concurrent root.
   *
   * After all Gossip has been delivered, the resulting Sequence is retained and
   * used to initialize a fresh Projection. Recreation must preserve the exact
   * visible Projection, including the deterministic order of all concurrent
   * root subtrees.
